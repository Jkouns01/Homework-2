# Homework-2
<h1> README</h1> 
<p> This homework assignment was designed to challence and see what I could accomplish with CSS and HTML. I wanted to make it as close to the example as possible but, struggled in some areas I will revise in the near future.
The purpose of the finished website will be a platform where future employers and clients can contact me. 
I learned how to fwrite an HTML from the start as well as play with CSS and see what works and does not work. </p>
